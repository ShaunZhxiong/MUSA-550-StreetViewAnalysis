                <h2>Why street views?</h2>
                <p>Street view images represent real-world scenery from a pedestrian perspective. By analyzing the
                    elements
                    in street view images, the urban built-environment can be better modelled. <sup>

                    </sup>

                </p>
                <h2>How did we collect the images?</h2>
                <p>Given the streets class by <a
                        href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/street-centerlines">OpenDataPhilly</a>,
                    streets' class lower than minor arterial are not considered to exclude local pathes did we barely
                    have
                    street view images. Then, a set of points is selected from the streets with a distance of
                    100m(328ft). And street view images are collected according to these points throuth <a
                        href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/choose-your-bing-maps-api">Bing
                        Map Api</a>. </p>
                <h2>How did we quantify the elements in these images?</h2>
                <p>An Image Segmentation method <a href="">SegNet</a> is used to analyzing the elements and their
                    proportion in the images. The elements in the images are devided into different classes, like trees,
                    roads, cars or sidewalks.</p>

                    Distribution of Elements</h1>
                <p>We first count the pixel number of each segment (each color), and calculate the proportion of
                    each segment by dividing the total pixel number of them.</p>
                <p>Then, we combined the output elements into ten categories (Green, Wall, Lives, Building,
                    Infrastructure, Road, Sidewalk, Sky, Transportation, and Public service), which will make the
                    analysis more concise and intuitive.</p>
                <p>We plot each category of street view point in the map of Philadelphia, using color to represents the
                    proportion of each category. The purple represents a low proportion and the yellow represents a high
                    proportion.
                    <b> Clusters can be observed from most categories, especially in lives, road and green.</b>

                Based on above quantitative diagram. We attach labels to these four categories, which may describe
                the feature of these clustering. The labels are as follow.

                <h5 style="color: #E55756;">1: High-density</h5>

                This clustering mainly distributes at the center city which is the most prosperous area in Philadelphia,
                and it has more buildings, less green, and more openness (less wall and more road) compared to other
                areas.

                <h5 style="color: #55A24A;">2: Lush</h5>

                This clustering mainly distributes at the west and mid-north Philadelphia. The features of this
                clustering are low building density, high street greening, and wide road.

                <h5 style="color: #72B7B3;">3: Spacious</h5>

                This clustering distributes around large natural parks. And besides this, it has relatively less
                buildings. These two indicated that it is easier to see the sky in the street, which also validated by
                the analysis. And also this category has more walls, less open to the public compared to other areas.

                <h5 style="color: #F58518;">4: Townhouse</h5>

                As this name, townhouse, indicates, the mainly building type within this clustering is townhouse.
                Therefore, this clustering has more greening, which is mainly made up of private lawns and gardens of
                townhouses, and less road.

                <p>From the plot, we can see that when the percentage of the white are at the mid-range, the street
                    will have more buildings, lives, public service and transportation. That means <b>a mixed community
                        will bring vitality to the street</b>, and we should encourage the confusion. However, we also
                    see <b>the
                        white-majority communities enjoy a more greening and open street while the other communities

                <p>A scatter plot is used to present the correlation between each street element and crime incident.
                    To further examine the relationship, <b>we ran an OLS regression, where the crime count
                        is the dependent variable and the street components are the independent variables</b>. This
                    regression's
                    aim is not to accurately predict the crime count, but to see the coefficient and the significance of
                    each independent
                    variable to the crime count. (Due to some confidence interval cross over "0", so even these
                    Building, Road, and Sidewald variables have negative coefficient in the regression model, they
                    display a positive relationship in the scatter plot)
                </p>
                <p>The figure below describes the coefficient of each element, along with their confidence interval.
                    Element such as lives, sky, public service, and green are significant. Specifically, elements lives
                    and public service have a positive relationship with crime numbers, while sky and green have a
                    negative relationship with crime numbers, which means that streets with more green and less people
                    is correlated with less crimes. </p>

            <p>In order to further explore the relationship between different types of crime and street space, we
                have made a Parallel Map. In the plot, the x axis is the category of street elements, and the y axis
                is the proportion of street elements after standardization. Each line represents a crime record in
                Philadelphia in 2015, and its color is determined by the type of crime.
            </p>
            <p> We can know from the figure that <b>the street space where different types of crimes occur is
                    different. </b> Similar to the previous results, some elements, such as greenery, sky are more
                closely
                related to crime types. For example, comparing Aggravated Assault Firearm and Drug Law Violation, it
                can be found that drug related violations usually occur in streets with less greenery, fewer people,
                and less infrastructure.</p>
