## Guidelines

The project is open-ended. The topic and technologies used are up to you.
However, the it must satisfy **at least two of the items below**:

- Data is collected through a means more sophisticated than downloading (e.g. scraping, API).
- At least one of the datasets contains more than 1,000,000 rows.
- It combines data collected from 3 or more different sources.
- The analysis of the data is reasonably complex, involving multiple steps
  (geospatial joins/operations, data shaping, data frame operations, etc).
- You use one of the analysis techniques for urban street networks (e.g., osmnx, pandana), clustering (e.g., scikit-learn), or raster datasets
- You perform a machine learning analysis with scikit-learn as part of the analysis.
- The webpage includes a significant interactive component (cross-filtering, interactive widgets, etc)
